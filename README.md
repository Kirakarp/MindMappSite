# MindMappSite project created for High Tech Hacks 2022. This website contains the information about the MindMapp and links to another Github repo that contains the code for that MindMapp. However, in theory, when users access the MindMapp through this webpage, they should be able to find parks and meditation spots based on their location, as well as build up points as they use the MindMapp. Enough points would reward them with a badge, to encourage the thought that self-care should and can be very rewarding. In addition, this website contains further information to help them explore different means of self-care, though the links are still a WIP mostly because although I know that the header is covering everything because of the stacking, I worked really hard on the UI and I don't want to mess it up and I just want to go to sleep now. Anyways, thanks for reading my description that I made for no reason. I can't even win the Github prize cuz I'm international, so why am I doing this again? And this part doesn't even describe the website anymore. And yet I'm still writing even though my computer is freezing and I should prolly go to sleep. Oh well. I think this description is done now.
